The workshop begins by an explanation of the Origin of Distortion which occurs in every lifetime, and how, if this is not healed in each life, it carries over to the next life and manifests in different issues. This life, and then other Past Lives can be healed by using Karen’s quick & dynamic techniques enabling you to move forward in life.

Some of these skills that we will offer are ESL language skills, employment skills, and educate them on Canadian way of life and country&rsquo;s laws and regulations. We are also looking to create a resource room that they will be able to use for finding more information, staying in touch with the loved ones back home, finding a better education, and a good job.  Get involved: Russian Club of Toronto also recognizes that we have a big Russian community here in Toronto and we will work hard to reach out and volunteer to make this community a better and safer place to live for all. Our members will be strongly encouraged to make a difference within their community and organize volunteer groups for many community activities such as spring clean up, crime prevention awareness, fire safety, tree planting\/gardening and much more. We are looking to bring the Russian community together and make it one of Canada&rsquo;s most active and vibrant communities. We are also looking for ways to raise money and support the less privileged Russians here in Canada and also back home in Russia.

For Example the group will discuss a collection of youtube videos in Bar\/Restuarant. The video could be a collection of videos on Sarah Palin, or Iran, or amazing pet tricks. People can view the videos before hand and discuss during the meeting, and bring a smart phone view them then and there.\r\nThe group doesn't have views on one side or the other. Racial views on any issue any side are not welcome. The group will be pleasant and fair.  \r\nCurrent events can be discussed example a collection of articles related to the G20. Articles coming for the star, economist, Twitter, NY times, any place.\r\nI currently do the Non fiction bookclub. There the discussion is a group of about twenty people in usually a square. There everyone speaks one at a time variety of views, talk as little or a sizable amount. There are questions to give the meeting structure, the meet starts with first impressions. Its lite. No pressure say lots say little. Eat drink.  \r\nI got the idea for casual general discussion, from traveling. When I travelled I found where ever I went there was a bar in evening where everyone went drank and talked. I can remember a conversation in peru on the Maccu Picu trail where a German and Canadian were having conversation about the Canadian dollar, the Canadian convinced it would only go down, in 99.\r\n \r\n \r\nAn example of discussion material\r\nJib Jab http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eKYe1KiwywE\r\nDoes Jib Jab change peoples mind\r\nHow funny is Jib Jab compared to other material\r\nWho watches Jib Jab\r\n \r\nPro Facebook or aint facebook?\r\nSimple question news good or bad?\r\nWhat is the Future of Social media sites?\r\nSocial media sites become No. 1 online activity The Star Benny Evangelista New York Times News Service\r\nAmericans are spending a quarter of their Internet time on Facebook or other social networking sites, while online video games have passed sending email as the second most popular online activity, according to a new report from the Nielsen Co.\r\nThe report said that Americans spent 22.7 per cent of their online time on social networking or blogs in June 2010, a 43 per cent increase compared to June 2009.\r\nVideogame playing increased by 10 per cent in the same period to account for 10.2 per cent of time spent online, said Nielsen, which uses data gleaned from a select group of people the company monitors. Online videogames edged email usage, which declined 28 per cent to an 8.3 per cent share of online time.\r\nMeanwhile, time spent on Web portals decreased 19 per cent during the year to a 4.4 per cent share of all activity and instant messaging had a 4 per cent share, a 15 per cent drop.\r\nAnd viewing of online videos and movies increased 12 per cent to about 3.9 per cent of all activities, allowing that category to surge past online searches.\r\n&ldquo;Despite the almost unlimited nature of what you can do on the Web, 40 per cent of U.S. online time is spent on just three activities&mdash;social networking, playing games and emailing, leaving a whole lot of other sectors fighting for a declining share of the online pie,&rdquo; Nielsen analyst Dave Martin said in a news release.\r\nPalo Alto&rsquo;s Facebook Inc., which just announced it has surpassed 500 million active members worldwide, may be the most responsible for the shifting patterns of online activity.\r\nFacebook&rsquo;s status updates let members recommend news, videos or other interesting Web topics, or send instant and direct messages to each other. Meanwhile, the company is also moving to gain a bigger share of the online search market by testing a new feature called Facebook Questions.\r\nIn the social networking category alone, an overwhelming 84.8 per cent share of all online activities went to Facebook, whose members were logged on an average of 6 hours in the month. MySpace was a distant second at 5.6 per cent of the total time spent, with Twitter and Blogger tied for third with 1.1 per cent.\r\nIn the online games category, Redwood City&rsquo;s Electronic Arts accounted for about 16.7 per cent of the time spent, ahead of Irvine&rsquo;s Blizzard Entertainment, with about 11.5 per cent.\r\nBut Mafiawars.com, the Web site for the social media game Mafia Wars, came in third with a 5.2 per cent share of time spent, with Zynga Game Network Inc. of San Francisco, which makes Mafia Wars and the popular Facebook social game FarmVille, was not far behind at 4.6 per cent.\r\nOn mobile phones, however, email remained the most popular activity, increasing from a 37.4 per cent share to 41.6 per cent, Nielsen said.\r\nSocial networking came in third on mobile devices, although its share of overall activity increased 27.5 per cent.\r\nStill, Martin said, &ldquo;while convergence will continue, the unique characteristics of computers and mobiles, both in their features and when and where they are used, mean that mobile Internet behaviour mirroring its PC counterpart is still some way off.&rdquo;\r\n","name":"Toronto Meetup Review 20-40","members":"8","lat":"43.70000076293945","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"m4s 1p8","lon":"-79.4000015258789","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/c\/c\/2\/global_17055266.jpeg","group_urlname":"Toronto-Meetup-Review-20-40","organizer_name":"Ian","short_link":"","country":"ca","topics":[{"id":"264","urlkey":"friends","name":"Friends"},{"id":"713","urlkey":"diningout","name":"Dining Out"},{"id":"4422","urlkey":"socialnetwork","name":"Social Networking"},{"id":"8867","urlkey":"localpolitics","name":"Local Politics"},{"id":"10581","urlkey":"social","name":"Social"},{"id":"15083","urlkey":"intellectual-discussion","name":"Intellectual Discussion"},{"id":"17201","urlkey":"20s-30s-social","name":"20's & 30's Social"},{"id":"17866","urlkey":"meeting-new-people","name":"Meeting New People"},{"id":"25131","urlkey":"politics-local-and-national","name":"Politics--Local and National"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/4284632\/","rating":"0.00","daysleft":""},{"visibility":"public","link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Thumbs-Up-Theatre-Toronto\/","state":"ON","organizer_id":"12578239","join_mode":"0","city":"Toronto","who":"Theatre Lovers","id":"1683891","created":"Sat Jul 31 22:17:05 EDT 2010","updated":"Sat Aug 14 17:58:55 EDT 2010","description":"Do you like going to live theatre to see plays, musicals, comedies and other productions, but don't have anyone to go with?\nPlease join us!

TSPCamp 2010 was held on May 20, and featured 25 local and international speakers covering a wealth of SharePoint topics.\r\nWeb: http:\/\/www.tspug.com\/ Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/tspug\/","name":"Toronto SharePoint Users Group","members":"14","lat":"43.66999816894531","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"M6H 2P9","lon":"-79.43000030517578","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/0\/3\/global_16640051.jpeg","group_urlname":"TorontoSPUG","organizer_name":"Eli Robillard","short_link":"","country":"ca","topics":[{"id":"15373","urlkey":"sharepoint-technologies","name":"SharePoint Technologies"},{"id":"16136","urlkey":"asp-net","name":"ASP.net"},{"id":"17627","urlkey":"programming","name":"Programming"},{"id":"21866","urlkey":"microsoft-sharepoint-technology","name":"Microsoft SharePoint Technology"},{"id":"62223","urlkey":"sharepoint","name":"SharePoint"},{"id":"86082","urlkey":"sharepoint-networking","name":"SharePoint Networking"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/12593583\/","rating":"0.00","daysleft":""}],"meta":{"lon":-79.36000061035156,"count":20,"link":"http:\/\/api.meetup.com\/groups","next":"http:\/\/api.meetup.com\/groups?key=736a1b632d18206f753794a4b794d77&radius=5.0&order=ctime&state=on&city=Toronto&offset=1&format=json&page=20&lat=43.7400016785&country=ca&lon=-79.3600006104","total_count":572,"url":"http:\/\/api.meetup.com\/groups?key=736a1b632d18206f753794a4b794d77&radius=5.0&order=ctime&state=on&city=Toronto&offset=0&format=json&page=20&lat=43.7400016785&country=ca&lon=-79.3600006104","id":"","title":"Meetup Groups","updated":"Sun Aug 15 10:42:42 EDT 2010","description":"API method for accessing meetup groups","method":"Groups","lat":43.7400016784668}}
