Our goal is to create an environment where rubyists can learn together, regardless of skill level.\nTorontoRuby provides three avenues for continuous improvement and growth. First and foremost, we will provide an avenue for developers to present their ideas and experiences through presentations and lightning talks.\nSecond, we can only become better ruby developers through practice. That is why we will have hack nights and work as a team to develop great software, beginning with the TorontoRuby.org website.\nThird, we will continue to learn and grow by holding a book club where we as a group will pick a technical book and work together to dissect its ideas and lessons.\n","name":"Toronto Ruby Brigade","members":"33","lat":"43.650001525878906","group_photo_count":"0","zip":"M5A 3S5","lon":"-79.37000274658203","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/1\/3\/1\/global_15730401.jpeg","group_urlname":"torontoruby","organizer_name":"Kevin Faustino","short_link":"","country":"ca","topics":[{"id":"563","urlkey":"opensource","name":"Open Source"},{"id":"1040","urlkey":"ruby","name":"Ruby"},{"id":"1488","urlkey":"agile","name":"Agile Software"},{"id":"3833","urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Developers"},{"id":"7029","urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript"},{"id":"10209","urlkey":"web","name":"Web Technology"},{"id":"20837","urlkey":"ruby-on-rails","name":"Ruby On Rails"},{"id":"58162","urlkey":"nosql","name":"NoSQL"}],"organizerProfileURL":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/members\/8745032\/","rating":"5.00","daysleft":""}],"meta":{"lon":"","count":1,"link":"http:\/\/api.meetup.com\/groups","next":"","total_count":1,"url":"http:\/\/api.meetup.com\/groups?key=736a1b632d18206f753794a4b794d77&radius=25.0&order=ctime&offset=0&format=json&id=1659178&page=200","id":"","title":"Meetup Groups","updated":"Wed Aug 11 09:52:48 EDT 2010","description":"API method for accessing meetup groups","method":"Groups","lat":""}}
